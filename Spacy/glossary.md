# Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| Attribute | In linguistic analysis, "attribute" typically refers to a word or phrase that provides additional information about a noun. |
| Clause |A grammatical structure with both a nominal subject and a main verb phrase. If both elements are not present, then it cannot be a clause. Clauses express complete thoughts (independent clauses) or incomplete thoughts that rely on other parts of the sentence (dependent clauses). |
| Copular Verb | A verb that links a subject to a complement. "To be" is the main copular verb, but others include: seem, appear, keep, remain, grow, turn out, end up, smell, taste.
| Complex Transitive Verb| A complex transitive verb is a type of verb that requires both a direct object and an object complement. It needs these two specific things to complete its meaning. The "object complement" is additional information about the direct object and can take the form of a noun phrase (a group of words centered around a noun) or an adjective (a word that describes a noun). 
| Dependency labels |  Dependency labels in SpaCy represent different types of grammatical relationships and structures within sentences. They are all related to how words and phrases are connected and function in the syntax of a sentence. |
| Ditransitive verbs | Also known as double-object verbs, are a subset of transitive verbs that require both a direct object and an indirect object to complete their meaning in a sentence. |
| Lemma | In linguistics and natural language processing (NLP), a "lemma" refers to the base or dictionary form of a word. It is the canonical or citation form of a word, from which all its inflected forms (such as different verb conjugations or noun declensions) are derived. |
| Object Predicative | An object predicative occurs with complex transitive verbs and provides additional information about an object. It is usually a noun-phrase or a adjective phrase and normally directly follows the object. Example: "If a plant is being eaten by insects, it can produce chemicals to make its leaves __less tasty__." |
| Prepositional Object | A prepositional object is a noun phrase or nominal clause that is normally placed after a prepositional verb.  Example:  "We know ivory comes from __elephants__." |
| Prepositional Verb | A prepositional verb is a combination of a verb and a preposition that has a specific idiomatic meaning. Unlike phrasal verbs, which can have both idiomatic and literal meanings, prepositional verbs typically have a more fixed meaning and are not as common as phrasal verbs. Example:  The plane __took off__ on time.|
| Ergative verbs | A verb that can be both transitive and intransitive. |
| Expletive | In the context of linguistics and grammar, an expletive is a word or a phrase that serves a syntactic role but contributes little or no semantic meaning to the overall message of a sentence. |
| LSTM | Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, commonly used for sequential data processing. LSTM networks are designed to address the vanishing gradient problem associated with traditional RNNs, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data.  |
| Nominal subject | In the context of linguistics and grammar, is a type of subject in a sentence that is realized as a noun or noun phrase. |
| Phrase | A phrase is a group of related words that functions as a single unit within a sentence. It does not have a subject and a predicate (verb) working together. Phrases function as units within a sentence, often serving a specific role (e.g., noun phrase, prepositional phrase) but do not express a complete thought on their own. Example: "Under the table" |
| Predicate | The predicate is the part of the sentence that tells what the subject is doing or what is happening to the subject. It can be simple, consisting only of a verb, or it can include objects, complements, and other modifiers. | 
|Intransitive verbs |  An intransitive verb is a verb that does not require a direct object to complete its meaning in a sentence. In other words, an intransitive verb conveys its action without the need for an object to receive that action. The action of the verb is self-contained within the subject. Although an intransitive verb never takes an object, some intransitive verbs are followed by a prepositional phrase or adverbial phrase, which are different from direct objects. |
| RNN | A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed for sequential data processing and prediction. Unlike traditional feed-forward neural networks, which process inputs in a fixed and unchanging order, RNNs have connections that form directed cycles. This cyclic architecture allows them to maintain a hidden state, which can capture information about previous inputs in the sequence. The key feature of RNNs is their ability to maintain a hidden state that evolves over time as new inputs are processed. This hidden state serves as a kind of memory, enabling the network to capture dependencies and information from earlier parts of the sequence. This makes RNNs particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequential or time-series data. |
| Subject Predicative | A subject predicative complements a subject. It can be a noun phrase, an adjective phrase, or an ing-clause. It references the subject or provides additional information about the subject. The subject predictive only follows copular verbs.
| Subject | The subject is the person, place, thing, or idea that the sentence is about. It is often a noun or pronoun. For example, in the sentence "The cat is sleeping," "The cat" is the subject |
| Transitive verbs | A transitive verb is an action verb that acts upon or affects a noun or pronoun, known as the direct object. |
